### CI/CD
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) embody a culture, set of operating principles, and collection of practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. The implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline and is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement. CI/CD pipeline contains a set of instructions that runs defined software delivery/ deployment steps automatically. 
### Image 
Image is a complete blueprint of certain software product. It contains, program and needed libraries and binaries to run that program. 
### Container
Container is instance of an image. Every container is isolated process. It is possible to run n containers of an image. To create an instance of a particular image, we need a container runtime like docker, rocket. 
### Container runtime
In simple words a container runtime is a software that virtualize kernel of an operating system. A container gets code, binaries and libraries but no OS kernel from image recipe. But without OS kernel, it is not possible to run process. Here, a container runtime provides OS kernel to the container.
### Jenkins
Jenkins is a CI (continuous integration) server. It can schedule and run scripted pipeline. The open source community develops plugins for various kind of service. 
### Pipeline
A pipeline is a set of software deployment and delivery stages.
